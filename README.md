## AWMC Data in GeoJSON Format
 
One of the goals of the Ancient World Mapping Center (AWMC) is to provide freely accessable, highly accurate geospatial data for the ancient world. To facilitate this endeavor and support the linked data community, the AWMC will use this space on GitHub to offer our current working data set. Expect to see further enhancements and developments as we refine our old files and integrate new data sets into our work.
